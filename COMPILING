This will hopefully add up to specific instructions on how to set up an Android
environment in order to cross-compile perl - the interpreter - for Android.

This now includes basic instructions Gabor has listed down:

Download the source of Android from http://source.android.com/download and build
it using "make".

As I understand that will get you the right arm-eabi toolchain. The binary agcc
comes from there.

the frontend wrapper agcc is in the android-scripting repository in
tools/agcc/agcc.

In order to build perl in the android-scripting repository:
    cd perl/src/Cross/
    sh build-arm-android-sh

and to package the result:
    sh package-android-sh

I know I got a failure as my sh was linked to dash.
Running bash worked better but I have not managed to setup the agcc thing.

*Alternative Instructions*

** Requirements **
In order to build perl for ASE, you need:
* ASE source - includes the Perl interpreter (A.K.A., perl)
* AGCC - GCC for Arm (A.K.A., agcc)
* The Arm EABI Toolchain (A.K.A., arm-eabi-toolchain)
* Java 5 (in case you want to compile Android)

The ASE source can be fetched from the ASE website.
It includes the agcc wrapper as well under "tools".

The arm-eabi-toolchain can be fetched from this github repo:
http://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain

It includes instructions on how to install it on Ubuntu.

These instructions assume you do not need to install or compile Android itself,
but if you find that you do (whether by choice or force), you need to install
Java 5 which can be fetched from Sun's java website. Check for "older version"
of Java.

** Compiling **
Once you have downloaded all components and installed the arm toolchain, build
them using the instructions in the repo.
