This will hopefully add up to specific instructions on how to set up an Android
environment in order to cross-compile perl - the interpreter - for Android.

This now includes basic instructions Gabor has listed down:

Download the source of Android from http://source.android.com/download and build
it using "make".

As I understand that will get you the right arm-eabi toolchain. The binary agcc
comes from there.

the frontend wrapper agcc is in the android-scripting repository in
tools/agcc/agcc.

In order to build perl in the android-scripting repository:
    cd perl/src/Cross/
    sh build-arm-android-sh

and to package the result:
    sh package-android-sh

I know I got a failure as my sh was linked to dash.
Running bash worked better but I have not managed to setup the agcc thing.
