This is a collection of Perl scripts that run on Android using ASE.

You can install an Android emulator using instructions from the Android
developers website and then install ASE (Android Scripting Environment).
Once you have it, you can install a Perl interpreter.

Hopefully these scripts will show an example of how to develop on Android with
Perl.

Directory structure:
bugs:       scripts that cover certain bugs
examples:   actual examples of programs which should be integrated with ASE
modules:    modules we want to (or have) integrated into ASE
scriptlets: small little scripts that haven't materialized or stabilized
Android.pm: the main Android module
test.pl:    our testing suite
README:     this file
